# The 7th Saga - seed manipulation tool
This is a tool for manipulating random outcomes in The 7th Saga. Specifically, it's for getting +4 stats from seeds.

To use, start the program and start recording a lone NPC's movement. Keep recording the NPC's step directions until there is only one match left. The NPC's upcoming movements will be displayed as a sequence of arrows, terminated
on the next right arrow. Use a stat seed right before the NPC moves to the right to get +4 stats.
